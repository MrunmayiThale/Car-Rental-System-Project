# Car-Rental-System-Project
A car rental system based on Java OOP concepts could include classes such as Car, Customer,RentalRecord, and RentalAgency.

1. *Car Class*: Contains attributes like car ID, model, make, year, rental status, and availability.
2. *Customer Class*: Represents the renter with attributes like customer ID, name, contact details.
3. *RentalRecord Class*: Keeps track of rental details such as rental ID, customer ID, car ID, rental duration, and rental cost.
4. *RentalAgency Class*: Manages the rental operations including renting out cars, returning cars, generating rental records, calculating rental charges, etc.

The system would involve methods like renting a car, returning a car, checking availability, calculating rental charges, generating rental records, and managing the fleet of cars.
